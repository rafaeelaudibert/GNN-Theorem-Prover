# :mag: Theorem Prover
This repository contains code explorations to create an end-to-end First Order Logic Theorem prover, using a GNN (more specifically TGN), with GPT-2 as baseline, created in my Scientific Initiation at [INF](https://inf.ufrgs.br) - [UFRGS](https://www.ufrgs.br)

The results obtained, if successfull, will be used in a paper possibly called "End-to-End theorem prover using Typed Graph Networks".
